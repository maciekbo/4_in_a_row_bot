This is a bot to "connect 4" game writen by Maciej Boro≈Ñ.
Run the file 'bot' on Linux and 'win_bot.exe' on Windows.

The human player uses 'O' and the computer uses 'X'.

The player and the computer drop their 'pieces', one at a turn. To drop your 'O' in a column, type it's number and press enter (you can queue moves by typing many numbers separated by spaces, however it's not recomended). Whenever you get 4 pieces in a row, column or diagonal, you win. Have fun!
